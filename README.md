**Project Description** 

This project involves applying Machine Learning techniques to analyze data provided by the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) example (*omics data, motor scores, and brain imaging, etc). The primary objectives are to create a predictive model for enhanced diagnosis as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous nature of individuals affected by Parkinson's diseasein progressive stages of their disease trajectory with variety of machine learning models, including supervised, unsupervised, and neural network models.

**Installation**

## Table of Contents
- [Excluding Pateints]
In the file "excluded_patients.ipynb" we extract patients that are either using dopaminergic medication or having mutation genes.
- [Proteomic CSF Table]

In the file "proteomic-table.ipynb" you can find code on how to make the table which contains the proteomic csf genes with patients and their diagnosis

- [Proteomic CSF Machine Learning]

In the file "proteomic-ML.ipynb" you can find the code with predictive model using xgboost for dianosis of PD vs Control.

- [Motor Score ]

In the file "motor_score.ipynb" you can find a ML test for UPDRS total score.

- [The rest]

We are working on the rest.
