    "## Introduction\n",
    "By employing machine learning in PPMI clinical data set, we can develop predictive models that aid in the early diagnosis of the disease. These models can potentially identify specific genetic markers or gene signatures that correlate with disease progression or response to treatment.\n",

    "- [Matrix of Gene Ids and Pateint Numbers](#matrixcreation)\n",
    "- [Data Preprocessing](#preprocessing)\n",
    "- [Model Training](#training)\n",
    "- [Results and Evaluation](#results)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix of Gene Ids and Pateint Numbers\n",
    "- Loading the data from IR3/counts folder and extracting the associated last column (counts) of each patient file for their BL visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing \n",
    "- We remove patients that have these diseases: SNCA (ENRLSNCA), GBA (ENRLGBA), LRRK2 (ENRLLRRK2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "Build and train machine learning models on the prepared data. Explain the choice of models, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. Provide code and comments to walk through the model training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Evaluation\n",
    "Present the results of the trained models, including performance metrics, accuracy, or any relevant evaluation measures. Interpret the findings and discuss the implications. Include visualizations or tables to support the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Summarize the key findings, limitations of the analysis, and potential future work or improvements. Offer closing remarks or suggestions for further exploration.\n",
